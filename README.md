### What is Vue?

- Understandable
- Fast
- Flexible

It allows developers to quickly prototype user interfaces, but also build full scale applications that are continuously growing. It can be adopted incrementally or used to build SPA's that can make use of Vuex state management and the Vue-router.

### How it works?

There are tons of articles out lining how Vue works and how the internals unfold but as I understand it they didn't help me too much, ghey may help you so I've attached those anyway.

[Demystifying Vue Internals](https://medium.com/js-imaginea/the-vue-js-internals-7b76f76813e3) - good for learning about compilation and reactivity

[Understanding the virtualDOM and rendering](https://medium.com/@koheimikami/understanding-rendering-process-with-virtual-dom-in-vue-js-a6e602811782) - good for rendering and how the virtualDOM works in Vue

[A Vue handboook](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-vue-handbook-a-thorough-introduction-to-vue-js-1e86835d8446) - A great handbook with broad learnings on Vue

[How to build vue components like a pro](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-build-vue-components-like-a-pro-fd89fd4d524d) - Good to learn how to build class components with slots and props, and create functional templates

These are all great but the take a lot of reading, I'm going to simplify this with some simple code and build this as a quick guide that can be used to reference for beginners.


+ how does it work then...
